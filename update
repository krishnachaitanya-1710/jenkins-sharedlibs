**A3P Status Update:**

1. **S3 Upload Activity Validation:**
   - We have successfully validated the S3 upload activity in one of the A3P AWS accounts used as a platform account. This validation was conducted under the assumption that all prerequisites, such as account access and assume roles for the pipelines, are in place.

2. **EC2 Deployment Enablement:**
   - Currently, there are ongoing discussions about performing or enabling deployments to on-demand EC2 instances through user data orchestration. 
   - We have identified several items that need to be completed from our end, based on these ongoing conversations. These items are subject to change as the discussions progress.

3. **Discussion and Analysis Phase:**
   - The deployment enablement to on-demand EC2 instances is still in the discussion and analysis phase. We are actively engaging in these conversations to ensure all necessary requirements and steps are thoroughly understood and planned.

4. **Attached Reference:**
   - I have attached the current list of minimum tasks we need to accomplish for the A3P onboarding for further reference and context.
