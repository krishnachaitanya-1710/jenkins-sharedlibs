Sure, here's a shorter version:

Dear DSO Customer Care Team,

Thank you for reporting the issue. The application is currently using the `javamavens3` use case, which supports both S3 upload and Lambda update by default. If the AD team only wants the S3 upload feature, we have two options:

1. **Switch to an Existing Use Case:** If a use case exists that supports only S3 upload, the AD team should switch to that use case.
2. **Create a New Use Case:** If no such use case exists, we need to create one and update the application's configuration accordingly.

Please confirm if there is an existing use case for S3 upload only, or if we should proceed with creating a new one.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
