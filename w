Hi Samantha,

Thank you for the update and for streamlining the use cases. Merging Use Case 2 into Use Case 1 makes sense and simplifies the process. I will send the updated TDD shortly.

Regarding the packaging of artifacts, I have a few points and questions to better understand the AD team's approach:

1. **Packaging Methodology:** Could you clarify why there is a consideration to build a jar inside another jar? If we are using Maven as our build tool, it typically packages everything into a single jar. This same jar can then be extracted by the pipeline and its content copied to the mainframe target folders. 
2. **Standalone Jars:** Are the AD team producing standalone jars, or are they packaging their application in a different manner? Understanding this will help us determine whether to go with a zip or jar format. From my perspective, using a jar would be more straightforward, but I am open to discussing the best approach.
3. **Packaging Process:** To gain a better understanding, could we schedule a call with the AD team to walk through how they are packaging their application? This will provide us with a clearer picture and help us make a more informed decision.

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this. Looking forward to your response and scheduling the call.

Best regards,
Sai
