Hi [Manager's Name],

I have outlined the minimum tasks we need to accomplish for the A3P onboarding:

1. New use case onboarding in SSP.
2. Ensure AWS account information is available in SSP.
3. Make AWS account information accessible in DDP pipelines.
4. Set up prerequisites such as assume role-related components in A3P.
5. Implement ASG refresh logic.

Please let me know if there are any additional tasks or if you have any feedback on this list.

Best regards,  
[Sai]
