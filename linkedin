Hi Dina,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I got your contact information from my previous manager, who speaks very highly of you. I wanted to reach out because I know of a candidate who would be a perfect fit for the DTCC environment or any cloud platform requirements you might have.

Currently, she is looking for C2C or C2H opportunities, and if sponsorship is possible, she would be open to W2 positions as well. I would be happy to share her profile with you if you are interested.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
