Hi [Manager's Name],

Regarding the request to scrape the "Deployment is not ready" status in the pipeline and project an appropriate error message for users, I have reviewed the current process and have some observations and suggestions.

### Observations
1. **Variable Error Messages:** The message "Deployment is not ready" can appear in various forms and contexts, making it challenging to scrape consistently.
2. **Pipeline Integration:** Directly scraping log outputs within the pipeline may not be the most efficient or reliable method due to the variability in error messages and the need for real-time log processing.

### Suggestions
1. **Helm Error Handling:** Utilize Helm's built-in error handling capabilities. Helm commands (`helm install`, `helm upgrade`) return non-zero exit codes upon failure. We can capture these exit codes in the pipeline to detect failures.
2. **Enhanced Logging:** Implement more structured logging within our Helm charts and Kubernetes configurations to output specific and consistent error messages. This structured logging can then be parsed more easily by the pipeline.
3. **Health Checks and Probes:** Use Kubernetes health checks (readiness and liveness probes) to determine the state of deployments. The status of these checks can be monitored and reported within the pipeline.
4. **Custom Scripts:** Develop custom scripts or tools to parse the Kubernetes events and pod statuses. These scripts can provide more detailed and user-friendly error messages based on the conditions observed.
5. **Webhook Notifications:** Set up Kubernetes webhook notifications to alert us in real-time when deployments fail or do not become ready. These notifications can be integrated with the pipeline to provide immediate feedback.

### Implementation Proposal
1. **Error Code Capture:** Update the pipeline scripts to capture Helm exit codes and log outputs, and trigger alerts or specific error messages when non-zero exit codes are detected.
2. **Structured Logs:** Modify our Helm charts and Kubernetes configurations to include structured log messages that can be more easily parsed and interpreted.
3. **Deployment Status Checks:** Incorporate additional steps in the pipeline to check the status of deployments using `kubectl` commands, focusing on readiness and liveness probes.
4. **Automation and Notification:** Develop scripts to automate the parsing of Kubernetes events and set up webhook notifications for real-time alerts on deployment failures.

By implementing these suggestions, we can provide more accurate and actionable error messages to users, enhancing the overall deployment process.

Please let me know if we can schedule a meeting to discuss this approach further and outline the next steps.

Best regards,
Sai
