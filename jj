**Title:** Enhancement of Region Selection for Release Candidates for Cloud Use Cases

**Story Points:** [Estimate]

**Priority:** [Priority Level]

**Assignee:** [Your Name/Team]

**Description:**

As a DevOps engineer, I want to add a region parameter to release candidate packaging pipelines for cloud deployment use cases, so that AD can select the target region they want to deploy to while creating a valid release candidate. Currently, our pipelines default to `us-east-1` as the primary region for all cloud deployment use cases (e.g., 3PaaS builds and lambda updates). This setup works for general purposes like deploying to the default primary (`us-east-1`). However, it limits applications that need to deploy to other regions like Frankfurt.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Add Region Parameter:**
   - Update the pipeline configuration to include a region parameter.
   - Allow the selection of different target regions for cloud deployments.

2. **Test Deployment to Multiple Regions:**
   - Verify that the updated pipeline can deploy to `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, and other specified regions, including Frankfurt.

3. **Documentation and Training:**
   - Update relevant documentation to include instructions on how to specify the deployment region.
   - Conduct training or provide guidance to AD on how to select the target region during the release candidate creation process.

**Technical Notes:**

- Modify the pipeline scripts to accept and process a region parameter.
- Ensure compatibility with existing deployment scripts and processes.
- Perform extensive testing to ensure deployments are successful across different regions.
