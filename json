Design
1. Architecture Overview
The system architecture will be a multi-tier design, comprising the following layers:

Presentation Layer: The user interface built using Angular.
Business Logic Layer: The backend services implemented in Spring Boot.
Data Layer: Data storage and retrieval mechanisms, including NoSQL databases and S3 for global variables.
2. Components
User Interface (UI)

Chatbot Interface: An expandable and interactive UI allowing users to interact with the assistant.
Admin Dashboard: For managing Q&A content, viewing analytics, and updating stock answers.
Backend Services

Q&A Service: Handles queries by matching them to the pre-modeled Q&A database.
Fallback Service: Provides stock answers for unmodeled queries.
Analytics Service: Collects and processes data on user interactions, generating insights and reports.
Data Storage

NoSQL Database: For storing Q&A pairs and user interaction data.
S3 Bucket: For storing global variables and other configuration files.
3. Data Flow
User Query: A user inputs a query into the chatbot interface.
Query Processing: The backend services process the query:
If a match is found in the Q&A database, the appropriate answer is returned.
If no match is found, a stock answer is provided by the fallback service.
Analytics Logging: The query and the response are logged for analytics purposes.
Response Delivery: The response is displayed to the user on the chatbot interface.
Analytics Processing: Periodically, the analytics service processes the logs to generate reports on the number of queries, user engagement, and other metrics.
4. Security and Authentication
Service Principals and Managed Identities: For secure access to Azure resources.
OAuth2: For authenticating users and managing sessions.
5. Error Handling
Logging: Comprehensive logging of all interactions and errors.
Monitoring: Real-time monitoring and alerting for service disruptions or errors.
Conclusion
This technical design document provides a detailed plan for implementing the initial release of the EDSO Smart Assistant, focusing on the baseline requirements provided. The proposed architecture and components ensure a scalable, secure, and efficient system that meets the outlined goals.
