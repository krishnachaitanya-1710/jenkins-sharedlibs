Subject: Follow-Up on Request for Premium Processing of I-140 Application

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on my previous request regarding the premium processing of my I-140 application.

As you know, my H-1B visa expired on June 1st, and our law firm has applied for a one-year extension. While we are still awaiting the result of this application, I would like to highlight the current status of my PERM application. Initially filed in March 2022, it was rejected in January 2023 due to discrepancies with the Tampa Bay Times job posting. Subsequently, it was refiled in May 2023 and approved on June 3rd.

Given the approval of my PERM application, I am now at the stage of filing my I-140. As discussed previously, it was promised that the I-140 application would be processed through premium processing upon reaching this stage. Opting for premium processing would not only expedite the approval process but also enable me to apply for a three-year H-1B extension, thereby reducing ongoing costs and providing greater stability.

I kindly request an update on whether the HR department can support premium processing for my I-140 application. If not, I am prepared to handle the premium processing fee on my own to avoid any further delays.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your prompt response and support.

Best regards,

Subject: Authorization to Proceed with Premium Processing for I-140 Application

Dear [Law Firm Contact's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address the status of my I-140 application and the need for premium processing.

As you are aware, my H-1B visa expired on June 1st, and we are currently awaiting the result of the one-year extension application. Meanwhile, my PERM application, initially filed in March 2022 and refiled in May 2023 after an initial rejection, was approved on June 3rd.

Given the current circumstances and the importance of timely processing, I would like to proceed with premium processing for my I-140 application. Despite awaiting a response from HR regarding support for the premium processing fee, I have decided to expedite the process by covering the cost myself.

Please go ahead and apply for premium processing for my I-140 application. I am prepared to pay the associated fees to ensure a swift resolution and enable me to apply for a three-year H-1B extension once the I-140 is approved.

Thank you for your assistance and understanding. Please let me know the next steps to complete this process.
