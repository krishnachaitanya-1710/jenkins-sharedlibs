Hi Steve,

The message "Deployment is not ready" can appear in various forms and contexts, making it challenging to scrape consistently. Directly scraping log outputs within the pipeline may not be the most efficient or reliable method due to variability in error messages and the need for real-time log processing.

However, we can enhance our Helm response parsing logic within our pipelines. By analyzing the raw Helm output, we can identify specific error patterns and translate them into more user-friendly messages. We can leverage our existing error handling framework to categorize and handle specific Helm error states effectively. This approach can be included in Devin's efforts towards error handling enhancements.

Here are some key points for consideration:

1. **Structured Error Messages:** Collaborate with the OCP team to ensure that Helm charts generate structured and consistent log messages. This will make it easier to parse and interpret errors in the pipeline.

2. **Custom Parsing Script:** Develop a custom script or extend the existing error handling logic in our Jenkins pipeline. This script can parse Helm logs to identify and translate specific error patterns into clearer, more actionable messages for users.

3. **Enhanced DDP Integration:** Utilize our existing DDP error handling framework to provide detailed and categorized error messages based on the parsed Helm logs. This will help users quickly understand and address deployment issues.

By implementing these suggestions, we can significantly improve the clarity and usefulness of the error messages provided to our users, making it easier for them to understand and resolve deployment issues.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this approach further and outline the next steps for implementation.

Best regards,
Sai
