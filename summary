I'd like to provide an update regarding an issue we're experiencing with AquaSec scanning due to recent changes we introduced based on the CHS team's instructions. Here's a summary of the situation:

Previous Setup:
Commands: Used to invoke AquaSec without additional arguments and policies were empty.
Current Setup:
New Commands: We have added additional arguments such as containerRuntime: podman and scannerPath: /home/jenkins/scannerCli to support Podman as a container runtime.
Policy Changes: Introduced updates to policies under chs-pipeline.
Issue:
TRM Concerns: TRM has identified issues with the policy changes and has reached out to me for clarification.
Provided Information: I have explained the changes and the reasons behind them to TRM. They may reach out to you for further information.
Please be aware of this update and the potential inquiries from TRM regarding the policy changes.

Best regards,
